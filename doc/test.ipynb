One subproblem of this is to clas-\\nsify academic citations in scienti(cid:2)c articles ac-\\ncording to their rhetorical function, e.g., as a\\nrival approach, as a part of the solution, or\\nas a (cid:3)awed approach that justi(cid:2)es the cur-\\nrent research. Here, we introduce our anno-\\ntation scheme with 12 categories, and present\\nan agreement study.\\n\\n1 Scienti(cid:2)c writing, discourse structure\\n\\nand citations\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in\\napplying natural language processing technologies to\\nscienti(cid:2)c literature. The overwhelmingly large num-\\nber of papers published in (cid:2)elds like biology, genetics\\nand chemistry each year means that researchers need\\ntools for information access (extraction, retrieval, sum-\\nmarization, question answering etc). There is also in-\\ncreased interest in automatic citation indexing, e.g.,\\nthe highly successful search tools Google Scholar and\\nCiteSeer (Giles et al., 1998).1 This general interest in\\nimproving access to scienti(cid:2)c articles (cid:2)ts well with re-\\nsearch on discourse structure, as knowledge about the\\noverall structure and goal of papers can guide better in-\\nformation access.\\n\\nShum (1998) argues that experienced researchers are\\noften interested in relations between articles. They\\nneed to know if a certain article criticises another and\\nwhat the criticism is, or if the current work is based\\non that prior work. This type of information is hard\\nto come by with current search technology. Neither\\nthe author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abstract, nor raw citation counts help users\\nin assessing the relation between articles. And even\\nthough CiteSeer shows a text snippet around the phys-\\nical location for searchers to peruse, there is no guar-\\nantee that the text snippet provides enough information\\nfor the searcher to infer the relation. In fact, studies\\nfrom our annotated corpus (Teufel, 1999), show that\\n69% of the 600 sentences stating contrast with other\\nwork and 21% of the 246 sentences stating research\\ncontinuation with other work do not contain the cor-\\nresponding citation; the citation is found in preceding\\n1CiteSeer automatically citation-indexes all scienti(cid:2)c ar-\\nticles reached by a web-crawler, making them available to\\nsearchers via authors or keywords in the title.\\n\\nLi and Abe 96\\n\\nBrown et al. 90a\\n\\nChurch and Gale 91\\n\\nResnik 95\\n\\nRose et al. 90\\n\\nHindle 93\\n\\nNitta and Niwa 94\\n\\nDagan et al 93\\n\\nDagan et al. 94\\n\\nHindle 90\\n\\nPereira et al. 93\\n\\nHis notion of similarity\\nseems to agree with our\\nintuitions in many cases,\\nbut it is not clear how it\\ncan  be used directly to\\nconstruct word classes\\nand corresponding \\nmodels of association.\\n\\nFollowing Pereira et al, we measure\\nword similarity by the relative entropy\\nor Kulbach-Leibler (KL) distance, bet-\\nween the corresponding conditional\\ndistributions.\\n\\nFigure 1: A rhetorical citation map\\n\\nsentences (i.e., the sentence expressing the contrast or\\ncontinuation would be outside the CiteSeer snippet).\\nWe present here an approach which uses the classi(cid:2)ca-\\ntion of citations to help provide relational information\\nacross papers.\\n\\nCitations play a central role in the process of writing\\na paper. Swales (1990) argues that scienti(cid:2)c writing\\nfollows a general rhetorical argumentation structure:\\nresearchers must justify that their paper makes a con-\\ntribution to the knowledge in their discipline. Several\\nargumentation steps are required to make this justi(cid:2)ca-\\ntion work, e.g., the statement of their speci(cid:2)c goal in\\nthe paper (Myers, 1992). Importantly, the authors also\\nmust relate their current work to previous research, and\\nacknowledge previous knowledge claims; this is done\\nwith a formal citation, and with language connecting\\nthe citation to the argument, e.g., statements of usage of\\nother people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approaches (often near textual segments\\nin the paper where these approaches are described), and\\nstatements of contrast with them (particularly in the\\ndiscussion or related work sections). We argue that the\\nautomatic recognition of citation function is interest-\\ning for two reasons: a) it serves to build better citation\\nindexers and b) in the long run, it will help constrain\\ninterpretations of the overall argumentative structure of\\na scienti(cid:2)c paper.\\n\\nBeing able to interpret the rhetorical status of a ci-\\ntation at a glance would add considerable value to ci-\\ntation indexes, as shown in Fig. 1. Here differences\\nand similarities are shown between the example paper\\n(Pereira et al., 1993) and the papers it cites, as well as\\n\\n\\x0c81\\n\\nthe papers that cite it. Contrastive links are shown in\\ngrey (cid:150) links to rival papers and papers the current pa-\\nper contrasts itself to. Continuative links are shown in\\nblack (cid:150) links to papers that are taken as starting point of\\nthe current research, or as part of the methodology of\\nthe current paper. The most important textual sentence\\nabout each citation could be extracted and displayed.\\nFor instance, we see which aspect of Hindle (1990) the\\nPereira et al. paper criticises, and in which way Pereira\\net al.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work was used by Dagan et al. (1994).\\n\\nWe present an annotation scheme for citations, based\\non empirical work in content citation analysis, which\\n(cid:2)ts into this general framework of scienti(cid:2)c argument\\nstructure. It consists of 12 categories, which allow us\\nto mark the relationships of the current paper with the\\ncited work. Each citation is labelled with exactly one\\ncategory. The following top-level four-way distinction\\napplies:\\n\\n(cid:15) Weakness: Authors point out a weakness in cited\\n\\nwork\\n\\n(cid:15) Contrast: Authors make contrast/comparison with\\n\\ncited work (4 categories)\\n\\n(cid:15) Positive: Authors agree with/make use of/show\\ncompatibility or similarity with cited work (6 cat-\\negories), and\\n\\n(cid:15) Neutral: Function of citation is either neutral, or\\nweakly signalled, or different from the three func-\\ntions stated above.\\n\\nWe (cid:2)rst turn to the point of how to classify citation\\nfunction in a robust way. Later in this paper, we will\\nreport results for a human annotation experiment with\\nthree annotators.\\n2 Annotation schemes for citations\\nIn the (cid:2)eld of library sciences (more speci(cid:2)cally, the\\n(cid:2)eld of Content Citation Analysis), the use of informa-\\ntion from citations above and beyond simple citation\\ncounting has received considerable attention. Biblio-\\nmetric measures assesses the quality of a researcher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noutput, in a purely quantitative manner, by counting\\nhow many papers cite a given paper (White, 2004;\\nLuukkonen, 1992) or by more sophisticated measures\\nlike the h-index (Hirsch, 2005). But not all citations\\nare alike. Researchers in content citation analysis have\\nlong stated that the classi(cid:2)cation of motivations is a\\ncentral element in understanding the relevance of the\\npaper in the (cid:2)eld. Bonzi (1982), for example, points out\\nthat negational citations, while pointing to the fact that\\na given work has been noticed in a (cid:2)eld, do not mean\\nthat that work is received well, and Ziman (1968) states\\nthat many citations are done out of (cid:147)politeness(cid:148) (to-\\nwards powerful rival approaches), (cid:147)policy(cid:148) (by name-\\ndropping and argument by authority) or (cid:147)piety(cid:148) (to-\\nwards one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends, collaborators and superiors). Re-\\nsearchers also often follow the custom of citing some\\n\\n1. Cited source is mentioned in the introduction or\\ndiscussion as part of the history and state of the\\nart of the research question under investigation.\\n2. Cited source is the speci(cid:2)c point of departure for\\n\\nthe research question investigated.\\n\\n3.

Cited source contains the data (pertaining to the\\ndiscipline of the citing article) which are used\\nsporadically in the article.\\n\\n5.

Many classi(cid:2)cation schemes for citation func-\\ntions have been developed (Weinstock, 1971; Swales,\\n1990; Oppenheim and Renn, 1978; Frost, 1979; Chu-\\nbin and Moitra, 1975), inter alia. Based on such an-\\nnotation schemes and hand-analyzed data, different in-\\n(cid:3)uences on citation behaviour can be determined, but\\nannotation in this (cid:2)eld is usually done manually on\\nsmall samples of text by the author, and not con(cid:2)rmed\\nby reliability studies. As one of the earliest such stud-\\nies, Moravcsik and Murugesan (1975) divide citations\\nin running text into four dimensions: conceptual or\\noperational use (i.e., use of theory vs. use of techni-\\ncal method); evolutionary or juxtapositional (i.e., own\\nwork is based on the cited work vs. own work is an al-\\nternative to it); organic or perfunctory (i.e., work is cru-\\ncially needed for understanding of citing article or just\\na general acknowledgement); and (cid:2)nally con(cid:2)rmative\\nvs. negational (i.e., is the correctness of the (cid:2)ndings\\ndisputed?). They found, for example, that 40% of the\\ncitations were perfunctory, which casts further doubt\\non the citation-counting approach.\\n\\nOther content citation analysis research which is rel-\\n\\n\\x0c82\\n\\nevant to our work concentrates on relating textual spans\\nto authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 descriptions of other work. For example, in\\nO\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1982) experiment, citing statements (one\\nor more sentences referring to other researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 work)\\nwere identi(cid:2)ed manually. The main problem encoun-\\ntered in that work is the fact that many instances of cita-\\ntion context are linguistically unmarked. Our data con-\\n(cid:2)rms this: articles often contain large segments, par-\\nticularly in the central parts, which describe other peo-\\nple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research in a fairly neutral way. We would thus\\nexpect many citations to be neutral (i.e., not to carry\\nany function relating to the argumentation per se).\\n\\nMany of the distinctions typically made in content\\ncitation analysis are immaterial to the task considered\\nhere as they are too sociologically orientated, and can\\nthus be dif(cid:2)cult to operationalise without deep knowl-\\nedge of the (cid:2)eld and its participants (Swales, 1986). In\\nparticular, citations for general reference (background\\nmaterial, homage to pioneers) are not part of our an-\\nalytic interest here, and so are citations (cid:147)in passing(cid:148),\\nwhich are only marginally related to the argumentation\\nof the overall paper (Ziman, 1968).\\n\\nSpiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1977) scheme (Fig. 2) is an exam-\\nple of a scheme which is easier to operationalise than\\nmost. In her scheme, more than one category can apply\\nto a citation; for instance positive and negative evalu-\\nation (category 9 and 10) can be cross-classi(cid:2)ed with\\nother categories. Out of 2309 citations examined, 80%\\nsubstantiated statements (category 8), 6% discussed\\nhistory or state of the art of the research area (cate-\\ngory 1) and 5% cited comparative data (category 5).\\n\\nCategory Description\\nWeak\\nCoCoGM\\n\\nCoCoR0\\nCoCo-\\n\\nCoCoXY\\nPBas\\nPUse\\nPModi\\n\\nPMot\\n\\nPSim\\nPSup\\n\\nNeut\\n\\nWeakness of cited approach\\nContrast/Comparison in Goals or Meth-\\nods (neutral)\\nContrast/Comparison in Results (neutral)\\nUnfavourable Contrast/Comparison (cur-\\nrent work is better than cited work)\\nContrast between 2 cited methods\\nauthor uses cited work as starting point\\nauthor uses tools/algorithms/data\\nauthor\\ntools/algorithms/data\\nthis citation is positive about approach or\\nproblem addressed (used to motivate work\\nin current paper)\\nauthor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work and cited work are similar\\nauthor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work and cited work are compat-\\nible/provide support for each other\\nNeutral description of cited work, or not\\nenough textual evidence for above cate-\\ngories or unlisted citation function\\n\\nmodi(cid:2)es\\n\\nadapts\\n\\nor\\n\\nFigure 3: Our annotation scheme for citation function\\n\\nOur scheme (given in Fig. 3) is an adaptation of the\\nscheme in Fig. 2, which we arrived at after an analysis\\nof a corpus of scienti(cid:2)c articles in computational lin-\\nguistics. We tried to rede(cid:2)ne the categories such that\\nthey should be reasonably reliably annotatable; at the\\nsame time, they should be informative for the appli-\\n\\ncation we have in mind. A third criterion is that they\\nshould have some (theoretical) relation to the particu-\\nlar discourse structure we work with (Teufel, 1999).\\n\\nOur categories are as follows: One category (Weak)\\nis reserved for weakness of previous research, if it is ad-\\ndressed by the authors (cf. Spiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using\\xe2\\x80\\x99s categories\\n10, 12, possibly 13). The next three categories describe\\ncomparisons or contrasts between own and other work\\n(cf. Spiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using\\xe2\\x80\\x99s category 5). The difference be-\\ntween them concerns whether the comparison is be-\\ntween methods/goals (CoCoGM) or results (CoCoR0).\\nThese two categories are for comparisons without ex-\\nplicit value judgements. We use a different category\\n(CoCo-) when the authors claim their approach is bet-\\nter than the cited work.\\n\\nOur interest in differences and similarities between\\napproaches stems from one possible application we\\nhave in mind (the rhetorical citation search tool). We\\ndo not only consider differences stated between the cur-\\nrent work and other work, but we also mark citations if\\nthey are explicitly compared and contrasted with other\\nwork (not the current paper). This is expressed in cat-\\negory CoCoXY. It is a category not typically consid-\\nered in the literature, but it is related to the other con-\\ntrastive categories, and useful to us because we think\\nit can be exploited for search of differences and rival\\napproaches.\\n\\nThe next set of categories we propose concerns pos-\\nitive sentiment expressed towards a citation, or a state-\\nment that the other work is actively used in the cur-\\nrent work (which is the ultimate praise). Like Spiegel-\\nR\\xc2\\xa4using, we are interested in use of data and methods\\n(her categories 4, 5, 6, 7), but we cluster different us-\\nages together and instead differentiate unchanged use\\n(PUse) from use with adaptations (PModi). Work\\nwhich is stated as the explicit starting point or intellec-\\ntual ancestry is marked with our category PBas (her\\ncategory 2).\\nIf a claim in the literature is used to\\nstrengthen the authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument, this is expressed in\\nher category 8, and vice versa, category 11. We col-\\nlapse these two in our category PSup. We use two\\ncategories she does not have de(cid:2)nitions for, namely\\nsimilarity of (aspect of) approach to other approach\\n(PSim), and motivation of approach used or problem\\naddressed (PMot). We found evidence for prototypi-\\ncal use of these citation functions in our texts. How-\\never, we found little evidence for her categories 12 or\\n13 (disproval or new interpretation of claims in cited\\nliterature), and we decided against a (cid:147)state-of-the-art(cid:148)\\ncategory (her category 1), which would have been in\\ncon(cid:3)ict with our PMot de(cid:2)nition in many cases.\\n\\nOur fourteenth category, Neut, bundles truly neutral\\ndescriptions of other researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 approaches with all\\nthose cases where the textual evidence for a citation\\nfunction was not enough to warrant annotation of that\\ncategory, and all other functions for which our scheme\\ndid not provide a speci(cid:2)c category. As stated above, we\\ndo in fact expect many of our citations to be neutral.\\n\\n\\x0c83\\n\\nCitation function is hard to annotate because it in\\nprinciple requires interpretation of author intentions\\n(what could the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention have been in choos-\\ning a certain citation?). Typical results of earlier cita-\\ntion function studies are that the sociological aspect of\\nciting is not to be underestimated. One of our most fun-\\ndamental ideas for annotation is to only mark explicitly\\nsignalled citation functions. Our guidelines explicitly\\nstate that a general linguistic phrase such as (cid:147)better(cid:148)\\nor (cid:147)used by us(cid:148) must be present, in order to increase\\nobjectivity in (cid:2)nding citation function. Annotators are\\nencouraged to point to textual evidence they have for\\nassigning a particular function (and are asked to type\\nthe source of this evidence into the annotation tool for\\neach citation). Categories are de(cid:2)ned in terms of cer-\\ntain objective types of statements (e.g., there are 7 cases\\nfor PMot). Annotators can use general text interpreta-\\ntion principles when assigning the categories, but are\\nnot allowed to use in-depth knowledge of the (cid:2)eld or\\nof the authors.\\n\\nThere are other problematic aspects of the annota-\\ntion. Some concern the fact that authors do not al-\\nways state their purpose clearly. For instance, several\\nearlier studies found that negational citations are rare\\n(Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975; Spiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using,\\n1977); MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1984) argue that\\nthe reason for this is that they are potentially politically\\ndangerous, and that the authors go through lengths to\\ndiffuse the impact of negative references, hiding a neg-\\native point behind insincere praise, or diffusing the\\nthrust of criticism with perfunctory remarks.\\nIn our\\ndata we found ample evidence of this effect, illustrated\\nby the following example:\\n\\nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Huang\\net al. 1990) offer a powerful statistical ap-\\nproach to this problem, though it is unclear\\nhow they could be used to recognise the units\\nof interest to phonologists. (9410022, S-24)2\\n\\nIt is also sometimes extremely hard to distinguish\\nusage of a method from statements of similarity be-\\ntween a method and the own method. This happens\\nin cases where authors do not want to admit they are\\nusing somebody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s method:\\n\\nThe same test was used in Abney and Light\\n(1999).\\n(0008020, S-151)\\nUni(cid:2)cation of indices proceeds in the same\\nmanner as uni(cid:2)cation of all other typed\\nfeature structures (Carpenter 1992).\\n\\n(0008023, S-87)\\n\\nIn this case, our annotators had to choose between\\n\\ncategories PSim and PUse.\\n\\nIt can also be hard to distinguish between continu-\\nation of somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research (i.e., taking somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n2In all corpus examples, numbers in brackets correspond\\nto the of(cid:2)cial Cmp lg archive number, (cid:147)S-(cid:148) numbers to sen-\\ntence numbers according to our preprocessing.\\n\\nresearch as starting point, as intellectual ancestry, i.e.\\nPBas) and simply using it (PUse). In principle, one\\nwould hope that annotation of all usage/positive cate-\\ngories (starting with P), if clustered together, should re-\\nsult in higher agreement (as they are similar, and as the\\nresulting scheme has fewer distinctions). We would ex-\\npect this to be the case in general, but as always, cases\\nexist where a con(cid:3)ict between a contrast (CoCo) and a\\nchange to a method (PModi) occur:\\n\\nIn contrast to McCarthy, Kay and Kiraz,\\nwe combine the three components into a sin-\\ngle projection.\\n(0006044, S-182)\\n\\nThe markable units in our scheme are a) all full cita-\\ntions (as recognized by our automatic citation proces-\\nsor on our corpus), and b) all names of authors of cited\\npapers anywhere in running text outside of a formal\\ncitation context (i.e., without date). Our citation pro-\\ncessor recognizes these latter names after parsing the\\ncitation list an marks them up. This is unusual in com-\\nparison to other citation indexers, but we believe these\\nnames function as important referents comparable in\\nimportance to formal citations. In principle, one could\\ngo even further as there are many other linguistic ex-\\npressions by which the authors could refer to other peo-\\nple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work: pronouns, abbreviations such as (cid:147)Mueller\\nand Sag (1990), henceforth M & S(cid:148), and names of ap-\\nproaches or theories which are associated with partic-\\nular authors.\\nIf we could mark all of these up auto-\\nmatically (which is not technically possible), annota-\\ntion would become less dif(cid:2)cult to decide, but techni-\\ncal dif(cid:2)culty prevent us from recognizing these other\\ncases automatically. As a result, in these contexts it is\\nimpossible to annotate citation function directly on the\\nreferent, which sometimes causes problems. Because\\nthis means that annotators have to consider non-local\\ncontext, one markable may have different competing\\ncontexts with different potential citation functions, and\\nproblems about which context is (cid:147)stronger(cid:148) may oc-\\ncur. We have rules that context is to be constrained to\\nthe paragraph boundary, but for some categories paper-\\nwide information is required (e.g., for PMot, we need\\nto know that a praised approach is used by the authors,\\ninformation which may not be local in the paragraph).\\nAppendix A gives unambiguous example cases\\nwhere the citation function can be decided on the ba-\\nsis of the sentence alone, but Fig. 4 shows a more typ-\\nical example where more context is required to inter-\\npret the function. The evaluation of the citation Hin-\\ndle (1990) is contrastive; the evaluative statement is\\nfound 4 sentences after the sentence containing the ci-\\ntation3. It consists of a positive statement (agreement\\nwith authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 view), followed by a weakness, under-\\nlined, which is the chosen category. This is marked on\\nthe nearest markable (Hindle, 3 sentences after the ci-\\ntation).\\n\\n3In Fig. 4, markables are shown in boxes, evaluative state-\\n\\nments underlined, and referents in bold face.\\n\\n\\x0c84\\n\\nS-5 Hindle (1990)/Neut proposed dealing with the\\nsparseness problem by estimating the likelihood of un-\\nseen events from that of (cid:147)similar(cid:148) events that have been\\nseen.\\nS-6 For instance, one may estimate the likelihood of a\\nparticular direct object for a verb from the likelihoods\\nof that direct object for similar verbs.\\nS-7 This requires a reasonable de(cid:2)nition of verb simi-\\nlarity and a similarity estimation method.\\nS-8 In Hindle/Weak \\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, words are similar\\nif we have strong statistical evidence that they tend to\\nparticipate in the same events.\\nS-9 His notion of similarity seems to agree with our in-\\ntuitions in many cases, but it is not clear how it can be\\nused directly to construct word classes and correspond-\\ning models of association.\\n(9408011)\\n\\nFigure 4: Annotation example: in(cid:3)uence of context\\n\\nA naive view on this annotation scheme could con-\\nsider the (cid:2)rst two sets of categories in our scheme as\\n(cid:147)negative(cid:148) and the third set of categories (cid:147)positive(cid:148).\\nThere is indeed a sentiment aspect to the interpretation\\nof citations, due to the fact that authors need to make\\na point in their paper and thus have a stance towards\\ntheir citations. But this is not the whole story: many\\nof our (cid:147)positive(cid:148) categories are more concerned with\\ndifferent ways in which the cited work is useful to the\\ncurrent work (which aspect of it is used, e.g., just a\\nde(cid:2)nition or the entire solution?), and many of the con-\\ntrastive statements have no negative connotation at all\\nand simply state a (value-free) difference between ap-\\nproaches. However, if one looks at the distribution of\\npositive and negative adjectives around citations, one\\nnotices a (non-trivial) connection between our task and\\nsentiment classi(cid:2)cation.\\n\\nThere are written guidelines of 25 pages, which in-\\nstruct the annotators to only assign one category per\\ncitation, and to skim-read the paper before annotation.\\nThe guidelines provide a decision tree and give deci-\\nsion aids in systematically ambiguous cases, but sub-\\njective judgement of the annotators is nevertheless nec-\\nessary to assign a single tag in an unseen context. We\\nimplemented an annotation tool based on XML/XSLT\\ntechnology, which allows us to use any web browser to\\ninteractively assign one of the 12 tags (presented as a\\npull-down list) to each citation.\\n\\n3 Data\\nThe data we used came from the CmpLg (Computation\\nand Language archive; 320 conference articles in com-\\nputational linguistics). The articles are in XML format.\\nHeadlines, titles, authors and reference list items are\\nautomatically marked up with the corresponding tags.\\nReference lists are parsed, and cited authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 names\\nare identi(cid:2)ed. Our citation parser then applies regu-\\nlar patterns and (cid:2)nds citations and other occurrences of\\nthe names of cited authors (without a date) in running\\ntext and marks them up. Self-citations are detected by\\n\\noverlap of citing and cited authors. The citation pro-\\ncessor developped in our group (Ritchie et al., 2006)\\nachieves high accuracy for this task (96% of citations\\nrecognized, provided the reference list was error-free).\\nOn average, our papers contain 26.8 citation instances\\nin running text4.\\n4 Human Annotation: results\\nIn order to machine learn citation function, we are\\nin the process of creating a corpus of scienti(cid:2)c arti-\\ncles with human annotated citations, according to the\\nscheme discussed before. Here we report preliminary\\nresults with that scheme, with three annotators who are\\ndevelopers of the scheme.\\n\\nIn our experiment, the annotators independently an-\\nnotated 26 conference articles with this scheme, on the\\nbasis of guidelines which were frozen once annotation\\nstarted5. The data used for the experiment contained a\\ntotal of 120,000 running words and 548 citations.\\n\\nThe relative frequency of each category observed in\\nthe annotation is listed in Fig. 5. As expected, the dis-\\ntribution is very skewed, with more than 60% of the\\ncitations of category Neut.6 What is interesting is the\\nrelatively high frequency of usage categories (PUse,\\nPModi, PBas) with a total of 18.9%. There is\\na relatively low frequency of clearly negative cita-\\ntions (Weak, CoCoR-, total of 4.1%), whereas the\\nneutral(cid:150)contrastive categories (CoCoGM, CoCoR0,\\nCoCoXY) are slightly more frequent at 7.6%. This\\nis in concordance with earlier annotation experiments\\n(Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975; Spiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using,\\n1977).\\n\\nWe reached an inter-annotator agreement of K=.72\\n(n=12;N=548;k=3)7. This is comparable to aggreement\\non other discourse annotation tasks such as dialogue\\nact parsing and Argumentative Zoning (Teufel et al.,\\n1999). We consider the agreement quite good, consid-\\nering the number of categories and the dif(cid:2)culties (e.g.,\\nnon-local dependencies) of the task.\\n\\nThe annotators are obviously still disagreeing on\\nsome categories. We were wondering to what de-\\ngree the (cid:2)ne granularity of the scheme is a prob-\\nlem. When we collapsed the obvious similar cat-\\negories (all P categories into one category, and\\nall CoCo categories into another) to give four top\\nlevel categories (Weak, Positive, Contrast,\\nNeutral),\\nthis only raised kappa to 0.76. This\\n\\n4As opposed to reference list items, which are fewer.\\n5The development of the scheme was done with 40+ dif-\\n\\nferent articles.\\n\\n6Spiegel-R\\xc2\\xa4using found that out of 2309 citations she ex-\\n\\namined, 80% substantiated statements.\\n\\n7Following Carletta (1996), we measure agreement in\\nKappa, which follows the formula K =\\n1\\xe2\\x88\\x92P (E) where\\nP(A) is observed, and P(E) expected agreement. Kappa\\nranges between -1 and 1. K=0 means agreement is only as\\nexpected by chance.

Unfortunately,\\nKappa is only partially sensitive to such specialised dis-\\nagreements. While it will reward agreement with in-\\nfrequent categories more than agreement with frequent\\ncategories, it nevertheless does not allow us to weight\\ndisagreements we care less about (Neut vs more in-\\nformative category) less than disagreements we do care\\na lot about (informative categories which are mutually\\nexclusive, such as Weak and PSim).\\n\\nFig. 6 shows a confusion matrix between the two an-\\nnotators who agreed most with each other. This again\\npoints to the fact that a large proportion of the confu-\\nsion involves an informative category and Neut. The\\nissue with Neut and Weak is a point at hand: au-\\nthors seem to often (deliberately or not) mask their in-\\ntended citation function with seemingly neutral state-\\nments. Many statements of weakness of other ap-\\nproaches were stated in such caged terms that our anno-\\ntators disagreed about whether the signals given were\\n(cid:147)explicit(cid:148) enough.\\n\\nWhile our focus is not sentiment analysis, it is pos-\\nsible to con(cid:3)ate our 12 categories into three: positive,\\nweakness and neutral by the following mapping:\\n\\nOld Categories New Category\\nWeak, CoCo- Negative\\nPositive\\nCoCoGM, CoCoR0, CoCoXY, Neut Neutral\\n\\nPMot, PUse, PBas, PModi, PSim, PSup\\n\\nWeakness\\nPositive\\nNeutral\\n\\nWeakness\\n\\n9\\n\\n4\\n\\nPositive Neutral\\n\\n1\\n140\\n30\\n\\n12\\n13\\n339\\n\\nFigure 7: Confusion matrix between two annotators;\\ncategories collapsed to re(cid:3)ect sentiment\\n\\nhave only one case of confusion between positive and\\nnegative references to cited work.

The kappas measured on these datasets are\\ngiven in Fig. 8. The higher they are, the better the anno-\\ntators could distinguish the given category from all the\\nother categories. We can see that out of the informa-\\n\\n\\x0c86\\n\\ntive categories, four are de(cid:2)ned at least as well as the\\noverall distinction (i.e. above the line in Fig. 8: PMot,\\nPUse, CoCoGM and CoCoR0. This is encouraging,\\nas the application of citation maps is almost entirely\\ncentered around usage and contrast. However, the se-\\nmantics of some categories are less well-understood by\\nour annotators: in particular PSup (where the dif(cid:2)culty\\nlies in what an annotator understands as (cid:147)mutual sup-\\nport(cid:148) of two theories), and (unfortunately) PBas. The\\nproblem with PBas is that its distinction from PUse is\\nbased on subjective judgement of whether the authors\\nuse a part of somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous work, or base them-\\nselves entirely on this previous work (i.e., see them-\\nselves as following in the same intellectual framework).\\nAnother problem concerns the low distinctivity for the\\nclearly negative categories CoCo- and Weak. This is\\nin line with MacRoberts and MacRoberts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hypothesis\\nthat criticism is often hedged and not clearly lexically\\nsignalled, which makes it more dif(cid:2)cult to reliably an-\\nnotate such citations.\\n5 Conclusion\\nWe have described a new task: human annotation of\\ncitation function, a phenomenon which we believe to\\nbe closely related to the overall discourse structure of\\nscienti(cid:2)c articles. Our annotation scheme concentrates\\non contrast, weaknesses of other work, similarities be-\\ntween work and usage of other work. One of its prin-\\nciples is the fact that relations are only to be marked if\\nthey are explicitly signalled. Here, we report positive\\nresults in terms of interannotator agreement.\\n\\nFuture work on the annotation scheme will concen-\\ntrate on improving guidelines for currently suboptimal\\ncategories, and on measuring intra-annotator agree-\\nment and inter-annotator agreement with naive annota-\\ntors. We are also currently investigating how well our\\nscheme will work on text from a different discipline,\\nnamely chemistry. Work on applying machine learning\\ntechniques for automatic citation classi(cid:2)cation is cur-\\nrently underway (Teufel et al., 2006); the agreement\\nof one annotator and the system is currently K=.57,\\nleaving plenty of room for improvement in comparison\\nwith the human annotation results presented here.\\n6 Acknowledgements\\nThis work was funded by the EPSRC projects\\nCITRAZ (GR/S27832/01, (cid:147)Rhetorical Citation Maps\\nand Domain-independent Argumentative Zoning(cid:148)) and\\nSCIBORG (EP/C010035/1, (cid:147)Extracting the Science\\nfrom Scienti(cid:2)c Publications(cid:148)).\\n\\nReferences\\nSusan Bonzi. 1982.

      "The paper analyses the circumstances which resulted in theformulation of a disciplinary code by the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh (SAE) during the 1880s. The episode is related through historical biographies of two villainous practitioners: Henry Callender and Donald Smith Peddie. The absence of codified regulations pertaining to professional conduct in the early constitution of the SAE is explored in the context of prevailing vocational ideologies and the role of admission stipulations as socio cultural filtering devices. It is revealed that organisational responses to cases of criminal misconduct were positively correlated with the degree of \"offence visibility\" and the resultant level of adverse publicity. The protective and status-preserving motives for the framing of disciplinary rules by professional associations are also highlighted. The study emphasises the potential impact of the disreputable practition er on the construction and destruction of the institutions of professionalism.\n",

      "Although most Chartered Accountants naturally conform to those unwritten laws which must of necessity govern the conduct of any body of professional men associated together for their mutual good, yet cases sometimes arise that render it a matter for regret that there exists among accountants no admitted code of etiquette (The Accountant, 21.7.1894, pp.  637-8).\n",

      "\n",
      "Biographical studies have long been conducted by accounting historians due to their potential for revealing the \"influence of key individuals on accounting concepts, practice, and institutions\" (Previts et al., 1990, p.142). Recently, students of accounting professionalism, conscious of the exhortations of post-revisionist sociologists to investigate the \"massive historical variation\" in occupational experiences (Collins, 1990, p.21), have focussed on the meso-level analysis of specific professional groups and the micro-centred study of pivotal figures in the construction and implementation of institutional strategies. In particular, Lee has urged the investigation of how professionalisation \"is operationalised by a relatively few key individuals in positions of power and responsibility\" (I996, p.x). Such biographical studies inevitably concentrate on luminaries and the role of the vocational elite in the emergence and protection of organisational structures. This paper analyses the impact of a small minority of practitioners who comprised an internal menace to the association - members who resorted to crime and misconduct.\n",
      "Key actors are made audible and visible to historians through oral tradition and by the institutional and documentary legacies which testify to their positive achievements. By contrast, the focus here is on those individuals whose notorious and pernicious activities tarnished collective claims to professional status and thus ensured that they were considered best hidden from history . Yet, as will be shown, miscreant professionals also impacted on institutional configurations because their destructive behaviour could elicit organisational responses for the fortification or restoration of vocational standing. Historical biographies of the disreputable accountant may also provide insights into the motives, values and perceptions of a wider occupational populace and also reveal how contemporary social phenomena coloured the behaviour of the individual (Briggs, 1954). Analyses of the felonious practitioner may be particularly illuminative of the vocational attitudes and ideologies which prevailed in the early accountancy profession . The complexion of public responses to \"scandals\" in the profession also assist attempts to locate the occupation in the contemporary social structure.\n",
      "As an investigation into villainous members of the nascent accountancy profession the paper also seeks to extend the historical study of criminal behaviour among those who occupied middle and upper class statuses in advanced capitalism (Jenkins,  1987; Robb,  1992). The analysis of such \"upperworld\" 1 crime contrasts\n",

      "with the more prevalent studies of \"underworld\" criminality among the labouring masses (for example, Chesney, 1970; Emsley, 1987; Gattrell et al., 1987; Jones, 1982; Philips, 1977; Weiner, 1990). As Robb has shown, the increasing complexity of finance and corporate structures in the maturing industrial economy offered substantial opportunities for the perpetration of white-collar crime (1992, pp.6-7). Despite its contemporary significance and deleterious consequences for large numbers of investors, depositors and employees, the criminal upperworld of the nineteenth century has, until recently, received scant attention (ibid.). Given the occupational proximity of accountants to the commercial, industrial and financial communities, and the likely permeation of its ideals and standards of conduct to the business domain (ibid., pp.177-8), the historical interfaces between white-collar crime and the accountancy profession are especially deserving of greater attention. Recent historical investigations of professional conduct, ethics and discipline,\n",
      "such as those of Parker  on Australia  (1987,  1994) and Preston  et al. on the    US ( 1995), bear directly on the study of professional misdeeds and immorality reported in this paper. Parker's \"private interest model of professional accounting ethics\" provides a useful conceptual frame in which to consider organisational responses to revelations concerning the malfeasance of practitioners (1994, pp.510-16). The centrality of the insulation function of codes of conduct, the symbolic role of disciplinary processes and the importance of \"offence visibility\" provide useful tools to understanding the emergence of rules for the expulsion of criminal chartered accountants which are discussed here. The investigation by Preston et al. into the content of ethical codes during the twentieth century is pertinent in its revelations about how perceptions of what constitutes \"professional\" conduct are dynamic and reflect changing cultural contexts (ibid., p.509).\n",
      "This paper examines the interfaces between contemporary culture and professional (mis)behaviour in a different time and locale. The study differs from other recent work in that it applies depth biographical analysis to offending professionals rather than focussing on the changing content of formalised statements of conduct or the derivation of a model of professional ethics based on the scrutiny of numerous disciplinary cases. By examining the origins and activities of the few members of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh (SAE) who were deemed guilty of criminal misconduct from its formation in 1853 to the end of the nineteenth century, insights are gained into perceptions of vocational behaviour during the infancy of modern organised accountancy in the context of a small, localised, and highly status-conscious professional community. The nature and extent of organisational responses to each case of wrongdoing also illuminate the character of accounting institutions during the second half of the nineteenth century and contemporary perceptions of professional morality.\n",

      "Misconduct andthe professionalIdeal\n",
      "The royal charter of incorporation which was granted to the SAE in 1854 contained no references to the institution of disciplinary powers or procedures. In 1855 the Society issued its \"constitution and laws\". The closest which this document came to referring to the chastisement of disreputable members was the empowerment of the Council to consider and advise \"on all matters\" affecting the interests of the Society (Walker, 1988, p.313). In fact, the SAE did not formulate a disciplinary code until 1883-4 in the wake of events which are related in the second part of the paper.\n",
      "Given that the principal organisational model emulated by the public accountants in Edinburgh was the local legal profession, the absence from the early SAE rule book of any codified provisions relating to misconduct, is perhaps, surprising. The long-established institutions which represented and governed the profession of law in Edinburgh had introduced formalised disciplinary procedures well before the 1850s. Judges were vested with the power to reprimand, suspend or depose members of the Faculty of Advocates (the Scottish equivalent of barristers) (Index Jurid icus, 1852, p.145). The original regulations of the Society of Solicitors to the Supreme Courts in 1784 provided for the punishment of members who were deemed guilty or accused of malversation , dishonesty or breach of trust (Barclay, 1984, p.295). By the mid-nineteenth century the Council of the Society of Solicitors to the Supreme Courts was charged with the responsibility of adjudicating those instances of conduct by members \"which may be considered derogatory to the Profession\" (Bye-Laws and Regulations, 1851, p.3). Similarly, the rules of the more senior Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet provided for the appointment of Commissioners from among the members whose task was to consider cases of misconduct. As guardians of the profession, the Commissioners were given authority to inflict punishments on \"delinquent\" solicitors \"for the good of the calling\" (Acts and Regulations, 18ll, appendix; Index Juridicus, 1852, p.63).\n",
      "It is possible that the nascent SAE desisted from following the lawyer examples because the codification of disciplinary processes might have suggested (to a public suspicious of prevailing standards of business morality) that members of the new professional organisation were capable of unbecoming behaviour. However, the absence of provisions relating to conduct and discipline must also be considered in the context of prevailing professional ideologies. The latter also provide an essential backcloth to understanding contemporary responses to cases of professional crime and misconduct.\n",

      "Preston et al. have illustrated how attitudes towards vocational conduct in the American accountancy profession during the early twentieth century reflected contemporary cultural values. Protestantism, \"character\" and idealism ensured that the occupational association relied on the admission of men of moral integrity; their practice of altruism, adherence to a \"social ethic\" and loyalty to fellow professionals in order to discourage misconduct (1995, pp.514-22). Hence, \"The accountant's calling was governed not merely by written rules and regulation, but also by a belief in divine law and continuous examination by himself and his brethren\" (ibid., p.522). A similar attitude prevailed in Britain during the nineteenth century.\n",
      "Although some of the \"new\" professions in Victorian Britain sought to enhance occupational claims by instituting regulations pertaining to the conduct of members (Corfield, 1995, p.204), the contemporary professional ideal emphasised the adherence by the individual practitioner to the \"spirit\" or conventions of professional \"etiquette\" as opposed to the formulation of codified rules of conduct and discipline (Reader, 1966, pp.158-63). Compliance with acceptable patterns of professional behaviour was a matter of mutuality and loyalty to the association (Duman, 1979, p.118). The \"pressure of opinion\" exerted by professional brethren was often preferred to, or considered more effective than, the deterrent effects of disciplinary committees (Carr-Saunders & Wilson, 1933, p.420; Robb, 1992, p.177). Nineteenth century concepts of professionalism stressed the probity, dignity, honour and gentlemanly instincts of the practitioner. His self-definition and personal enforcement of the standards of propriety, \"civic morality\" and altruism commensurate with his status were considered to be the primary safeguards against unworthy conduct.\n",
      "The contemporary aversion to the codification of standards of conduct and the emphasis on social and moral controls to regulate vocational behaviour received expression in the accountancy press during the later nineteenth century. The accountant's adherence to conventional morality was considered essential to the maintenance of his professional demeanour. Good conduct would \"not be attained so much by regulation and bye-laws, as by the moral influence which members of a chartered body will gradually exercise amongst themselves\" (Accountant, 5.6.1880, p.4). At a general meeting of the newly formed Institute of Accountants in London in April 1871 the President, William Quilter, revealed the centrality of high morals to the standing of the public accountant:\n",
      "... something beyond mere professional knowledge and capability must be brought into the field of professional action, if the accountant is to maintain and consolidate the important position which of late years he has come to occupy in relation to the legal and mercantile community. By that something more, I mean the qualities of unswerving rectitude - fearless independence - and single mindedness in the conduct of the business entrusted to him ... the due execution of which would be impossible in the absence of the moral  qualities\n",

      "I have indicated . Without them, a man may be a clever accountant, but he will do nothing either to elevate his own individual status, or that of the profession to which he belongs (MS28/404/I, pp.8-9).\n",
      "The institution by British accountancy organisations of codified disciplinary rules to deal with cases of blatant or criminal misconduct was also deemed inappropriate during the nineteenth century because \"as a rule, conduct of this nature is either amenable to the law, which acts as an effectual deterrent, or it is so morally reprehensible that a man may be trusted to abstain from it simply from regard to his own interests\" (Accountant, 22.3.1879, p.3).\n",
      "It was in the context described above that previous to the 1880s, the rules of the SAE contained no provision for instigating the expulsion of a member (Walker, 1988, pp.305- 17). The name of a CA who persistently defaulted in the payment of subscriptions or failed to comply with the regulations of the Society, was simply and quietly erased from the roll of members. Those rare instances of complaint about the conduct of a CA (usually concerning the distribution of circulars to solicit business), 2 resulted in a discussion by the Council and a letter from the Secretary informing the member that such behaviour was in breach of the \"usual professional etiquette\" (Sederunt Book, 2/1, p.271; also Kedslie, 1990, p.272). A similar approach was adopted by the neighbouring Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow. The official history of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland relates how:\n",
      "... the Council of the Glasgow Institute, because of one or two cases which had been brought before the Professional Etiquette Committee, found it necessary in their report for 1908 to call attention to a Minute of Council dated January 30, 1865, bearing upon the question of canvassing for business, and to impress on members the extreme desirability of maintaining a high standard of professional etiquette in all their business relations with one another and with the public (A History of the Chartered Accountants of Scotland, 1954, p.54, italics added).\n",

      "Despite the absence of written rules relating to the misconduct and discipline of its members, the SAE was not devoid of mechanisms to prevent the tarnishing of its organisational status through the dishonourable behaviour of a CA. Admission regulations were configured not only to restrict entry to those individuals who were deemed unlikely to bring the occupation into disrepute but also to encourage the internalisation of accepted norms of professional conduct.\n",
      "Preston et al. have shown that during the early twentieth century, the reliance\n",
      "by the American accountancy profession on the integrity of the individual professional ensured that the organisation \"need not be fully responsible for the moral development of its membership, rather it need only admit and retain those persons exhibiting  'proper' character\" (1995, p.521).

      "accountancy profession in Victorian Britain, particularly the SAE. As claims to the credibility and probity of the practitioner rested on membership of the professional organisation, the emphasis was placed by the association on the imposition of admission stipulations which would prevent the intrusion of those considered capable of malfeasance. Conditions of entry, qualification procedures and certification ensured that only those deemed competent and reputable were allowed through to offer services to the public.\n",
      "In England and Wales, for example, the newly constituted Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAEW) stressed its implementation of examinations and four \"fundamental rules\" to prevent the admission of \"non public accountants\" who were considered least likely (due to the nature of their business engagements) to conduct themselves in a \"professional\" manner. In particular, the royal charter of 1880 empowered the ICAEW to \"lay down such rules respecting admission to membership and exclusion therefrom as would prevent Public Accoun.tants from mixing the pursuit of any other business with the discharge of the higher duties devolving on them as Public Accountants\" (Accountant, 12.6.1880, p.5, italics added; Millerson, 1964, p.163; Parker, 1986, pp. 57-9). The status implications which could arise from the combined practice of \"professional\" public accountancy and \"commercial\" broking (the latter activity not being constrained by the conventions of professional morality) is ably illustrated in Shackleton and Milner's analysis of a mixed accountancy practice in Glasgow during the late nineteenth century (1996, pp.  116-25; Accountant,  23.4.1892, pp. 329-30).3\n",
      "From the outset, membership of the SAE had been confined to the community of competent and respectable accountants (Index Juridicus, 1853, pp.x-xii; Sederunt Book, 2/1, p.5; Walker, 1995). At the end of the nineteenth century, despite the advance of the examination, senior office bearers continued to maintain that admission was restricted to \"gentlemen of professional standing\" (Sederunt Book, 2/2, p.161) and that the Society was exclusive \"as regards culture and conduct\" (quoted in Walker, 1988, p.xi). In 1892 the President of the SAE asserted that:\n",
      "We are willing according to our rules to admit any person into our Society of good character, who complies with the course of training and the requirements and qualification of the Society. We do not exclude persons otherwise, who satisfy what we regard as essential to the proper practice of the business (ibid., italics added).\n",
      "The ability of a potential member to pay substantial apprenticeship and entrance fees was also perceived as evidence of vocational commitment, pecuniary independence and gentility (ibid., pp.129-31 & 190-3; Shackleton, 1995, p.32). In this respect, the SAE was highly emulative of the local legal profession. During the 1850s admission to the Society of Solicitors to the Supreme Court was dependent on  the  candidate  being  \"of  good  moral  character\"  (Bye-laws  and Regulations,\n",

      "1851, p.3). Similarly, entrants to the Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet were expected to be \"of good fame and reputation\" (Acts and Regulations, 1811, p.8). As Duman has observed, although the recruitment of professionals was increasingly founded on meritocratic criteria in late Victorian Britain, the primary aim of selecting only those of good character \"seems to have remained constant\" (1979, p.123).\n",
      "Other conditions of admission to the SAE obstructed the entry of the individual considered likely to bring the vocation into disrepute. New members could only be admitted at annual meetings (where they would be visible to established professionals) and, in the early years of the Society's existence, only following formal nomination, seconding and on the approval of 75% of those present. Membership was also restricted to those who intended to practice their vocation within the relatively close spatial confines of Edinburgh . In 1882, the year of the formative case of misconduct discussed here, there were only 164 members of the SAE. Covert behaviour was difficult given the close social and occupational networks in the local professional community which encouraged mutualism and fraternity (Walker, 1993, p.133). The apprenticeship system was particularly important in fostering close connections and loyalties between practitioners. It comprised a medium for occupational socialisation and the inculcation of a professional ethos. Self-recruitment (particularly in the larger CA firms) was also a deterrent to unacceptable behaviour (Walker, 1988, pp.240-5). The good conduct of a CA father, son, brother, uncle or nephew was a familial as well as a professional obligation as the status ramifications of disgrace in such cases were not confined to the individual.\n",
      "Further, from 1860 until 1875 (when it was discovered that the Society had no power to act in the event of a contravention) (Minute Book, 3/1, p.42), the potential entrant to the SAE was obliged to sign a declaration that \"his exclusive object in Business is to follow the profession of an Accountant as defined in the Society's Charter\" ( ibid., p.59). This condition of membership ensured that the CA was restricted to contemporary prescriptions of \"professional\" practice and was informally constrained by the standards of conduct associated with that status. The SAE member was thereby distinguished from the non-credentialed and potentially unscrupulous \"accountant\" who owed allegiance to no professional organisation.\n",
      "The three organisations of chartered accountants in Scotland have been compared with the Inns of Court of English barristers (Carr-Saunders & Wilson, 1933, p.210). In relation to their respective modes of regulating professional conduct during the nineteenth century the analogy is not wholly inappropriate . Although the \"benchers\" of the Inns could wield disciplinary powers, as with the wider legal profession these were seldom invoked or were largely ineffective (Abel, 1988, pp.133 & 248-9; Duman, 1983, p.37; Lewis, 1982, pp.41-2). More effectual was the informal discipline and social control nurtured by the esprit de corps of    a\n",

      "The SAE's apparent emphasis on the prevention of, rather than reaction to, cases of misconduct through: admission procedures, spatial and jurisdictional restrictions on practice, professional socialisation, the visibility of individuals in a small occupational populace, reliance on the public practitioner's compliance with the law, and adherence to contemporary standards of etiquette and personal morality, proved extremely effective in minimising internal threats to the status of the professional populace. In 1900 the SAE boasted a membership of 351. Since its inauguration in 1853 the society had admitted over 450 individuals to its ranks. Of this number only two CAs were removed from membership for committing crime and professional misconduct. These individuals led undistinguished careers as sole practitioners, were largely secluded from the gaze of their fellow chartered accountants and were therefore less restrained by the socio-cultural impediments to dishonourable conduct.4 The relevant cases were those of Henry Callender, and, more importantly, Donald Smith Peddie. Both were signatories to the SAE's application for a royal charter in 1854. Hitherto the cessation of membership of Callender  and  Peddie  has been  either unaccounted  for (Brown,  1905, pp.364 &\n",
      "376) or hidden behind speculative and innocuous explanations pertaining to subscription arrears or retirement  (Stewart, 1986, pp.58 &  139).\n",

      "\n",
      "Domesticity was one of the most potent ideals in Victorian society (Davidoff & Hall, 1987, pp.180-92). The private world of home was rigidly separated from the public province of work (Thompson, 1988, p.197). This uncoupling of domains has ensured that identifying covert social relationships during the nineteenth century is often problematic due to their being \"veiled behind the Victorian culture of privacy and reticence\" (Harris, 1994, p.89). However, when accepted norms of behaviour were breached, resulting in the interposition of the legislature, the courts and the media, the circumstances attending violations of the law and contemporary moral standards were often subject to sensationalised disclosure. In this way, the details of a miscreant private life could periodically and legitimately enter the realm of the public. It is through such exposure that there exists evidence of the villainous activities of Henry Callender and Donald Smith Peddie.\n",

      "The offender, Henry Callender, was an original member of the SAE (Stewart, 1986, p.58). He was outwardly respectable and established as a public accountant. Callender was educated at Edinburgh University and his father had been an accountant in Edinburgh (Matriculation Registers, 1823-35). Callender commenced in public practice about 1838 at the age of 29 and was subsequently Manager of the Scottish Life Assurance and Guarantee Association and of the Professional Life Assurance Company ( Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory ). Callender became an associate member of the Institute of Actuaries, was a director of the Scottish Imperial Insurance Company and was also one time Treasurer of the City of Edinburgh.\n",
      "Callender's downfall concerned a municipal-related appointment. On 11 January 1873 The Scotsman reported that a meeting of The Water of Leith Sewerage Commissioners had been convened to consider \"the state in which the books have been left by the late treasurer, Mr Henry Callender, who some time ago disappeared  from Edinburgh\"  (11.1.1873, p.4). Defalcations  were  estimated   at\n",
      "2,600 and it was envisaged that further investigation would unearth more substantial frauds on the Commission. The press report concluded that the matter had \"been placed in the hands of the Procurator-Fiscal\" and that Callender appeared to have absconded to the United States (ibid.).\n",
      "The publicised revelation of alleged criminality by one of its members induced a swift response by the Council of the SAE. Two days after the press report a meeting of the Council was convened where it was resolved that: \"as appeared from public newspapers, Mr. Callender had left the country for America under heavy charges, they instructed the Secretary to delete his name from the List of Members of the Society when the same is printed\" (Sederunt Book, 2/1, p.200). As there was no specific constitutional procedure for dealing with such matters, this executive decision was not brought before the membership of the SAE and no alteration to the bye-laws of the Society resulted from the case.\n",
      "Compared to the Callender episode, the only other recorded instance of criminal misconduct by a member of the SAE during the nineteenth century generated a deluge of adverse publicity . As a result it elicited a greater and more enduring response from the professional organisation.\n",

      "Outwardly, Donald Smith Peddie was an archetypal original member of the SAE. He possessed several attributes which stamped him as an estimable professional accountant of reputable origin. Peddie was a grandson of a Lord Provost of Edinburgh and was the second son of the Reverend Dr James Peddie (Brown, 1905, p.376; Stewart, 1986, p.139).

      "of the United Presbyterian Church and an active participant in \"the benevolent and religious societies of Edinburgh\" (Kay, 1877, Vol.4, p.351), the Reverend Peddie was a prolific author and noted philanthropist (Dictionary of National Biography, Vol.XV, pp.648-9). As a result of his \"unblemished and useful life\" he \"enjoyed the esteem and reverence of all classes and all denominations of his fellow citizens\" (Kay, 1877, Vol.4, p.353).\n",
      "Donald Smith Peddie's elder brother, James, was a Writer to the Signet (the most eminent branch of the solicitor profession in Scotland) ( The Society of Writers to His Majesty' s Signet, 1936, p.286). James Peddie's son, John Dick Peddie, was a classical architect of considerable repute and the Liberal MP for Kilmarnock at the time when his uncle's misdemeanours came to light (Stenton & Lees, 1978, Vol.2, p.282). Peddie's younger brother, Reverend Dr William Peddie, succeeded his father as Minister of the Associate Burgher Congregation in Edinburgh (Small, 1904, pp.431-3). Donald Smith Peddie's credentials as an educated professional gentleman were enhanced by his having studied literature and law for six years at Edinburgh University  (Matriculation Registers,  1821-8).\n",
      "Peddie commenced practice as an accountant in 1831 at the age of 23 (Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories ). Following a short period in the office of his lawyer brother, he spent the remainder of his relatively undistinguished career as a sole practitioner. Peddie was also the accountant and agent for the Edinburgh office of the Yorkshire Fire and Life Insurance  Company ( Oliver and Boyd's, Insurance Advertisements ) and received several appointments under judicial factories and trusts (CS). From 1833 he assisted his ageing father in the treasuryship of the Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers in Scotland. This organisation was established in 1797 to provide for the widows and orphans of (mainly United Presbyterian) clergymen (Jeffrey, 1919) and its Treasurer earned an annual salary of 45 (CH3/5 l 6/8). Peddie augmented his limited practice income by rentals from a residential property in Edinburgh and also secured returns on an investment as a partner in a colliery company in Fife (CS318/30/239, Inventory). He was also the trustee of mineral workings near Dunfermline which he let to a coalmaster (Scotsman, 2.12.1882, p.6). Despite the variety of his interests, Peddie's pecuniary status was seldom stable. The cash books of the SAE reveal that during the late 1850s Peddie was in arrears with his subscriptions. In January 1864, the Commercial Bank of Scotland demanded that his cash credit of 1,500 be paid up due to its foundation on unsatisfactory security (Commercial Bank Minute Book, Vol.7, pp.220, 261, 267).\n",
      "Having been invited to join the newly formed Institute of Accountants in Edinburgh in January 1853 (Sederunt Book, 2/1, p.5), Peddie actively participated in the affairs of his professional organisation.

      "William Cornelius was born in Hanover, Germany in 1830 (Census Returns, 1871, 685/2/46). He trained as an artist at the Royal Academy in Munich and sometime thereafter removed to London and became a British subject. In 1863 he married Elizabeth Brown, a professional musician. Six years later Cornelius moved to Edinburgh and started a small business as a decorative artist to the local nobility and gentry (CS243/1255, Condescendence; Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1870-1). Cornelius's association with Peddie commenced when he rented a tenement flat from Peddie who was acting factor of the property which was owned by the Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers . (CS243/1255, Condescendence; CH3/516/10, p.15). It was possibly due to his being in arrears for 18 months rent that Peddie employed Cornelius to undertake some house painting. Cornelius's business venture proved unsuccessful and in August 1870 he was bankrupted  with realisable assets of 100 and liabilities of 370 (CS3l 8/l5/73).\n",
      "Following his discharge as a bankrupt in November 1870, Cornelius, with the assistance of Peddie, commenced a new house painting business from a more central location in Edinburgh (CS247/4875, Condescendence). As Cornelius had no capital it was verbally agreed that Peddie would, for a time, \"supply all moneys requisite for carrying on the extended business\", direct the firm and also meet the expenses of the Cornelius household (ibid.). For his part, Cornelius would remit all the income from the venture to Peddie. Under this arrangement Peddie claimed to have advanced 10,000 to Cornelius between 1871 and 1878 (CS243/1255/4 , Proof).\n",
      "In addition to his painting business Cornelius became increasingly involved in property speculation . He raised funds from Peddie and the Scottish Investment Company to acquire 28 tenement flats in Edinburgh. He also bought a residential property on the outskirts of the city and embarked on the construction of two suburban villas (CS243/1255/4, Proof). The completion of the latter required several injections of new capital. Between 1878 and 1881 Peddie supplied Cornelius with a total of 9,500 on the premise that \"I felt myself bound to carry on to a certain extent, for the sake of recouping myself ' even though he claimed to have lost hope of recovering the whole of his investment (ibid.). From August 1877 advances totalling 1,800 were also secured from J. & W.C. Murray, Writers to the Signet. This law firm granted loans to Cornelius on the basis of his appearance as \"a prosperous and well-to-do man\" (ibid.).\n",

      "Additional short tenn credit was extended to Cornelius by J. & W.C Murray in order to provide working capital for his increasingly unprofitable painting business and to alleviate his mounting personal debts. In December 1879 Cornelius's problems were compounded by his losing a legal dispute with a finn of joiners (ibid.). By that time both he and Peddie had exhausted their meagre incomes and became involved in a \"continual solicitation\" of J. and W.C. Murray for more credit (ibid.). Inthe early 1880s Peddie \"was in a perfectly impecunious state\" and begged daily for money to meet his personal liabilities  (ibid.).\n",
      "As Peddie became increasingly unable to sink further funds into Cornelius's projects, the hitherto close personal and business relations between the two men fractured. In a series of letters written to Peddie in 1881, Cornelius accused his associate of breaching their business arrangement, of refusing to pay creditors and of attempting to cause his bankruptcy (CS243/1255/3, 10.1.1881). In 1881 Cornelius complained that his decade-long acquaintance with Peddie had brought nothing but debt. He wrote:\n",
      "... as often before I even had not a shilling to take home to keep house with, the consequence is, debts are incurred, & I am continuously worried by numerous Tradesmen, for payment. I asked you sometime ago, to be so good and give me your acceptance for a paultry sum of two hundred pounds, to meet this drain on me, but even that you have not done as yet, it is impossible for things to go on much longer this way, something has to be done, and shall be done. I can not wear the fool's cap any longer (ibid., 22.4.1881 ;21.1.1881).\n",
      "From the autumn of 1881 Cornelius had greater cause to feel embittered. In November of that year J. & W.C. Murray issued a summons against Cornelius and Peddie for the recovery of 4,621 in advances and unpaid legal fees. Because most of the loans had been granted without guarantee or written agreement, the issue arose as to whether Cornelius (the principal) or Peddie (his agent), was responsible for making the repayments (CS243/1255/4 , Proof). Despite a tacit admission of responsibility by Peddie, on 7th July 1882, the court  detennined  that Cornelius was primarily  liable for the amount sued for (Scotsman, 8.7.1882, p.5).\n",
      "In May 1882 Peddie also raised a separate action in which he sought the recovery of 19,487 from Cornelius. This amount represented advances made from 1870 to 1881 (CS247/4875, Summons and Condescendence). Peddie claimed that unbeknown to himself, Cornelius had applied the funds to property speculation and that this was in breach of their mutual agreement to finance the extended house decorating business. In July 1882, being unable to comply with the pecuniary consequences of the court' s decision in J. & W.C. Murray v. Cornelius and Peddie, and with judicial progression of the litigation instigated by Peddie imminent, Cornelius adopted an alternative strategy to improve his financial status and seek retribution from his former business associate.\n",

      "On the day of the judgment in J. & W.C. Murray v. Cornelius and Peddie, Elizabeth Cornelius left her husband's abode. One week later, Cornelius issued a summons against his wife and Peddie in an action for divorce. He alleged that Peddie and Elizabeth had committed adultery and sought 10,000 damages from the CA in compensation for the ruination of his \"peace and domestic happiness\" (CS243/1255, Condescendence). Cornelius alleged that from 1871 to 1878 Peddie (who was unmarried and then in his mid-sixties) had sexual intercourse with his wife in Peddie's office, the Cornelius residence and various other locations (ibid.). Cornelius claimed that in December 1878 he had discovered intimate correspondence written by Peddie to Elizabeth. In response, Cornelius composed the following letter to his wife's  lover:\n",
      "My long felt suspicions are then now at last realised into Truth, the enclosed is a Copy of one of your corruptious letters written by you to my wife, I might have sent you a Copy of an other one, but they are all so filthy, so much so that I do not  like to soil my hands  with them. These are the deeds committed     by\n",
      "D.S. Peddie, Esq., my particular friend, [who) has gone every Sunday to Church, I say read this letter you fearful monster, you came as a Wolf in Lam Clothing to my house, why could you not leave me alone. Satan look at your destruction, what have you made of my poor Wife: a hur, a hur corrupted with your filthiness, poor soul. God have mercy on her and forgive her. do now what you like, you have done your utmost. if the Law of this Country would permit me I should know how to deal with you, give me satisfaction and do not tum a coward in the bargain . I am entitled to revenge, and will have it ... I shall have some ofthis letter printed in large type and post them up on walls, yes even on the pulpit of your Church [sic]  (CS243/1255/3).\n",
      "On receiving this letter, Peddie sent his lawyer to Cornelius in order to protest that no impropriety had taken place. Cornelius claimed to have been placated until 1881 when he resurrected claims that Peddie had caused him \"the greatest injury possible\" (CS243/1255, Condescendence) by seducing his wife and once more threatened retribution by revealing Peddie in his \"true colours before the publick\" (CS243/1255/3, 10.1.1881). In January 1881 he wrote to Peddie: \"I can assure you, you never made a greater mistake in your life if you think you have fairly saddled me with your prostitute\" (ibid.). As their business relationship became increasingly acrimonious, Cornelius demanded that Peddie forward 601 to cover business and household expenses inclusive of 150 for \"twelve months keep of your fancy woman\" (ibid., 18.8.1881).\n",
      "In their written response to the summons for divorce, Peddie and Elizabeth Cornelius offered an alternative description of events. Mrs Cornelius denied adultery and contested that her husband had deliberately attempted to prostitute her and desired that she develop a sexual relationship with Peddie in order to extort money.   Elizabeth   Cornelius  claimed   that  on  the  basis   of   threats   of public\n",

      "allegations of adultery, Cornelius had extracted 20,000 from Peddie and the current claim for damages comprised another attempt to fleece her co-defender (CS243/1255, Condescendence). Peddie concurred that Cornelius had \"tried every means in his power\" to encourage illicit liaisons between himself and Elizabeth Cornelius for the purpose of blackmail (ibid.). By contrast, Cornelius argued that his demands for money from Peddie were related to their unwritten business arrangement.\n",
      "The Cornelius divorce case opened at the Court of Session (the highest civil court in Scotland) in early November 1882 (CS243/1255/l). As with the other litigation in which Peddie was embroiled in 1882, the proceedings were reported in the Scottish press. The prevailing anti-sensualism of Victorian Britain (Mason, 1995) and the increasing publicity which attended divorce cases in the wake of matrimonial legislation in 1857, gave an added piquancy to the revelations of marital infidelity which emerged from law-suits involving those, like Peddie, who were outwardly respectable (Hammerton, 1992, pp.102- 18). On 15 November the judge determined that William Cornelius was entitled to explain his case in open court. Witnesses would be called and havers taken in order to establish or otherwise the allegations of consent and connivance (Scotsman, 16.11.1882, p.3).\n",
      "The prospect of detailed investigation into his private and business affairs and their public disclosure induced Peddie to flee. He left Edinburgh about 17 November 1882 and the next day wrote to his clerk from London that \"he was obliged to go from home for a few days\" (Times, 1.12.1882, p.7). It was subsequently reported that Peddie had absconded to Spain (ibid., 7.12.1882, p.7). On 22 December 1882 Peddie's property was sequestrated. The trustee revealed realisable assets of 4,656 - insufficient to satisfy his 36 creditors whose claims totalled almost 75,000 (CS318/30/239, Inventory). In January 1883 Cornelius too, was bankrupted (CS3 l 9/2754). On 31 January 1883 The Times reported that Peddie \"was buried in Philadelphia two months ago in Potter's field, under the name of John North\" (p.9).\n",
      "Peddie's rapid departure from Edinburgh was immediately perceived by the press as evidence of his guilt. As The Scottish Banking and Insurance Magazine related:\n",
      "The story was received at first with incredulity , at least as far as the criminal defalcations were concerned . But the fama received its best proof in that its subject took guilt to himself by flight (December 1882, p.266).\n",
      "The rumours of adultery and extortion induced Peddie's clients and creditors to scrutinise their accounting records . In particular, the suspicions of the Reverend William Peddie, nominal treasurer of the Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers, were excited. A committee to examine the books of the Society, which had been kept by his brother Donald, was inaugurated (CH3/516/l,  22.11.1882).\n",

      "By the end of November 1882 the first revelations concerning Peddie's criminality were reported in the Edinburgh press. On 30 November The Scotsman noted that it had been discovered that bills for 8,500 (later revised to 8,050), discounted by the Commercial Bank of Scotland and drawn by Peddie in the name of a coalmaster in Fife, were forgeries (p.4). On the same day the manager of the Commercial Bank informed his board:\n",
      "... that in consequence of the discovery that certain bills which had been discounted to Donald Smith Peddie, C.A., Edinburgh bore signatures which were alleged to be forgeries he had intrusted the Bank's Law Agents to malce a criminal charge against Peddie and that a Warrant had accordingly been granted for his apprehension . The Board approved of this step and agreed to defray according to customary outlay by the Police for telegrams & handbills with a view to his arrest (Minute Book, Vol.I I, p.21).\n",
      "The warrant was duly issued on 1 December 1882 and on 2 December it was revealed that the total of forged bills on the Commercial Bank uttered by Peddie might amount to 11,000.5 Itwas also suspected that Peddie had uttered forged bills of 2,000 on two other Scottish banks and had composed deeds relating to heritable property which \"are forgeries from beginning to end, even to the registration clause\" (Glasgow Herald, 4.12.1882, p.6). Five days later the Chief Constable of Edinburgh issued a notice (see page 24) offering a reward for information leading to Peddie's arrest.\n",
      "The defalcations committed by Peddie which caused most public outrage concerned his misappropriation of the funds of the Friendly Society of Dissenting Ministers. Having conducted a search of the records in Donald Smith Peddie's office, the committee appointed to investigate the Treasurer's Accounts reported on 6 December 1882 that only 5,000 of the 29,000 investments which were disclosed in the last annual report were secured (CH3/516/1, 6.1.1882; Edinburgh Evening News, 7.12.1882, p.2). At a subsequent meeting of the (140) members of the Society, it was resolved to institute a further examination of Peddie's involvement and to advise on whether legal liability for the frauds rested with the directors, the auditors, the actuaries and/or the treasurer (CH3/516/1 , 20.12.1882). The results of these deliberations were revealed in a comprehensive report which was issued to the members of the Society on 25 January 1883 and printed in\n",
      "the local press (CH3/516/10; Scotsman, 25.1.1883, p.5). It was shown that the total investments of the Society amounted to 30,940. Of this, 21,840 worth of securities were classified as \"bad\" due to their being either entirely fictitious (unsupported by deeds) or based on forged documents (CH3/516/10, pp.5-6). A further 4, 100 of assets were considered \"doubtful\" because it appeared that the investments had been realised but the proceeds were never entered in the Treasurer's   Accounts   maintained   by   Peddie.

      "collusion, apathetic directors and perfunctory auditing as factors which facilitated the defalcations of the CA. Among his many criminal devices for extracting monies from the Society (particularly during the 1870s) Peddie had assigned bonds to lunatics for whom he had been appointed curator by the courts and credited the funds to his own account (CH3/516/10, p.16).\n",
      "The report also showed that the Reverend Dr James Peddie was Treasurer of the Society from its inception in 1797 until his death in 1845 (ibid., pp.2-4). After 1833 he enlisted the assistance of his son Donald and as early as the 1840s funds were misappropriated by the treasurers. In 1844, anxious that frauds were not made public , the ageing Reverend Peddie recommended to the Committee of Management of the Friendly Society that Donald should formally succeed him as treasurer. It was decided, however, that Donald, who was not a member of the Society, was ineligible for the position (ibid.). In 1846 Reverend William Peddie was elected treasurer but due to his ignorance of the affairs of the Society, its management was left almost entirely to his accountant brother.\n",
      "The report into the frauds also revealed that after 1846 the directors had shown increasingly less interest in the investments of the Society and concerned themselves only with scrutinising day-to-day receipts and payments. The annual audit of the accounts of the Society, which consistently revealed a large surplus of funds, had been conducted by two directors (clergymen) in a superficial manner:\n",
      "... the payments to widows and petty disbursements were  carefully checked, and so were the various items of income ... but the investments themselves (the capital sums) were never ... properly checked with the deeds (ibid.,  p.4).6\n",
      "The Reverend Dr William Peddie also regretted that:\n",
      "... it has not been the custom for a long period of time to call for a sight of the bonds and compare and examine them, otherwise the frauds would have been detected. The auditors, like myself, had confidence in my brother ( Scotsman, 4.12.1882 , p.5).\n",

The story is a very painful one, because of the respectable position of many who are affected by it. It is also one of the most shameful ever laid before the public, because the persons defrauded are the widows and orphans of Dissenting clergymen, many of whom are wholly dependent on the annuities of the society for their livelihood (30.1.1883, p.8).\n",
      "The fact that Peddie, an overtly respectable professional of mature years who was born into a family of theologians, could commit adultery and perpetrate a fraud on a semi-religious institution to the potential ruination of those deemed most deserving of societal protection, shocked contemporaries:\n",
      "A VERY cruel blow has been given to an honoured name by the extraordinary course of fraud, immorality, and forgery pursued by Mr Donald Smith Peddie,\n",
      "C.A ... [who] revealed himself to be a whited sepulchre, the dishonourer of a good name, the devourer of widows' houses, the reckless debauchee, the smooth-faced swindler and forger. The personal part of the horrid story that now fills all men's mouths receives perhaps a keener point from the knowledge that the hoary sinner is in his seventy-fifth year, and has been pursuing a life which would shame a man in \"the May of youth and bloom of lustihood,\" and is positively appalling in a man of advanced years (Scottish Banking and Insurance Magazine, December 1882, p.266).\n",
      "The press reported that Peddie had been renowned for his high social status, piety, and participation \"in every religious movement for the benefit of the people\" (Scotsman, 26.1.1883, p.4). He had maintained a facade of being \"spotless in business\" and had \"the general reputation of a trustworthy man\" ( ibid.). The contrast between his public benevolence and private villainy to the detriment of 72 widows and a family of orphans induced The Scotsman to comment that \"No more painful story of its kind has been told for many a day\" ( ibid.). The Reverend Dr William Peddie acknowledged that his brother's misdemeanours had not only caused considerable shock to \"the public mind of the country\", but also dishonoured God and hurt religion (ibid., 21.12.1882,  p.5).\n",
      "The abhorrence at the Peddie frauds engendered an outpouring of sympathetic philanthropy. Even before the Friendly Society announced that it intended to remedy the deficiency in its funds by appealing to the public, senior Scottish politicians such as the Earl of Rosebery, and several leading citizens wrote to the press to volunteer contributions for the relief of the innocent widows and orphans (ibid.; CH3/516/l, 25.1.1883). By the end of 1883 the Relief Committee of the Friendly Society had collected  13,249 (CH3/516/2, p.45).\n",

      "article published one year earlier in The Financial Record, Economist, and Railway Review. In \"Trickeries of the Professions\" the CA was portrayed as a conceited and mercenary character who, under a veneer of selflessness, was driven by an insatiable desire \"to overstep his rivals, advance his own interests, and grasp all for himself ' (December 1881, p.281). The article asserted that the active participation of CAs in the church should not be construed as a symbol of devoutness and moral rectitude. Rather, it was an attempt to secure a clientele by nurturing congregational connections and to extend \"influence and gain a recognised character for steadiness\" (ibid .) . It was also argued that displays of overt public-spiritedness by the CA, such as offering subscriptions to good causes, were similarly motivated by the need to create a favourable impression with potential patrons and thereby \"contribute to his own profit\" (ibid.) . Peddie's dishonourable behaviour, despite his aura of professional respectability, philanthropy and association with religious institutions, served as a practical illustration of the apparent dichotomy between the public and private faces of the chartered accountant.\n",
      "The SAE, whose members had acquired \"inbuilt attitudes of social superiority and dominance\" (Shackleton & Milner, 1996, p.98; Walker, 1988, pp.12-21) over other public accountants was bound to act in order to ensure that the reputation of practitioners was not seriously tainted by the destructive conduct of one of its members.7\n",
      "The formulation of a disciplinary code\n",
      "Shortly after the Peddie defalcations broke in the press, the Council of the SAE were called to an urgent meeting to discuss \"special business\" (Letter Book, 74/1, p.414). On 5 December 1882 the President and Council convened to discuss the measures which might be taken in response to \"the very painful rumours, which, within the last few days had gained so much notoriety regarding Mr D.S. Peddie\" (Sederunt Book, 2/1, p. 12). The President considered that:\n",
      "... the uncontradicted narratives in the newspapers are alone sufficient justification for any action the Council may see fit to take: aad I anticipate there will be unanimity in our resolution that his name shall not again appear in the List of Members of the Society (ibid., p.313).\n",
      "However, as the annual list was not prepared and issued until early in the new year, it was not formally decided to remove Peddie's name from the roll until a meeting of the Council was held on 3 January  1883 ( ibid., p.316).\n",
      "At the latter meeting it was also resolved that the President, Secretary and law agent of the SAE should formulate a new bye-law giving the Council the \"power to expel from the Society, any member who is found guilty of Breach of Trust, fraud or misdemeanour of a similar kind\" ( ibid.). This remit was to be acted upon immediately in order that a draft regulation could be presented at the annual meeting of the Society in February. Under the constitution of the SAE the bye-law\n",

      "would have to be submitted to an annual meeting and ratified at the succeeding AGM. Accordingly, the bye-law was adopted by the Society in February 1883 and confirmed unanimously  one year later (Minute Book, 3/2, pp.23fr.7 &  263-4).\n",
      "The content of the bye-law was heavily influenced by the specifics of Peddie's misconduct. It was also wide ranging and uncompromising in its effort to prevent the profession from being tarnished by the behaviour of an individual miscreant. Public accusations of crime or \"any wrong doing\" were to be sufficient grounds for the President and Council to institute an enquiry which might result in a recommendation for the expulsion of a member:\n",
      "It shall be lawful for the Society, in the event of any member being convicted of Falsehood, Fraud and Wilful Imposition, or Embezzlement, or Forgery or uttering any forged document, knowing it to be forged, or of any other crime or misdemeanour to expel such member from the Society: and in the event of any member of the Society being publicly accused of any such crime or misdemeanours as aforesaid, or of any wrong doing sufficient to disqualify him from being a member of the Society, or in the event of any written information to that effect being given to the President or Secretary of the Society, it shall be the duty of the President and Council to make intimation in writing to such member that they will proceed on some day not less than ten from the date of such information, to consider the conduct of such member. and if after such enquiry as they shall deem sufficient, and after considering any explanations which such member may tender, they shall come to be of opinion that the member accused is guilty of such crime or misdemeanour or wrong doing, they shall report the conduct of such member to the first Annual General Meeting of the Society or to any Special General Meeting to be called for that purpose\n",
      "in terms of the Society's Byelaws, and on a motion being and carried, such member shall be expelled from the Society, in the same manner as if he had been convicted of any such crime or misdemeanour  (ibid., 312, pp.263-4 ,\n",
      "italics added).\n",
      "Although there is little evidence to suggest that it was used as a model by the SAE, the bye-law bore some similarities to the rules for expulsion which had recently been codified in the constitution of the ICAEW. The charter of 1880 enumerated six grounds for the initiation of proceedings leading to the possible removal or suspension of a member. These were: a breach of the fundamental rules of the Institute; criminal conviction; behaviour deemed \"disreputable to a Public Accountant\"; bankruptcy; engagements deemed incompatible with the practice of public accountancy; and, failure to pay subscriptions. However, ejection from the English Institute was only possible following a 75% vote by the Council of the Institute and on the accused having been heard (Accountant, 12.6.1880, p.7).\n",

      "Scottish accountancy profession during the 1890s. As part of their attempt to secure the registration of chartered accountants, the Scottish institutes formulated an Accountants (Scotland) Bill in 1896. The draft legislation proposed that a General Council would have the power to refuse to license an accountant who had been convicted \"of a crime or a fraud, or to have been guilty of any act or default discreditable to a professional accountant\" (Sederunt Book, 2/2, p.240).\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "The absence from the SAE's early constitution and laws of codified rules pertaining to matters of conduct and discipline, coupled with the perfunctory nature of much contemporary auditing and the professional's ability to maintain an aura of respectability, provided the vocational and cultural environment in which individuals like Donald Smith Peddie could, for many years, covertly lead a dual existence. When the public facade ruptured and the private life was exposed a single practitioner could potentially inflict considerable damage on the reputation of the occupation.\n",
      "The need to protect the profession from the adversities wreaked upon it by the activities of the malefactor ensured that characters such as Peddie, though a minute fraction of the occupational population, could have as significant and enduring an impact on the institutions of professionalism as their more illustrious peers famed for constructive contributions to the organisation. The grounds for expulsion specified in the bye-law formulated in the wake of the Peddie frauds were to be retained by the SAE as late as the merging of the three local CA societies as The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1951 (Charter of Incorporation, 1944, p.28; McDougall, 1980, p.75). The findings of this paper suggest, therefore, that the institutional development of a profession is not only exhibited in the lives of \"its great personalities\" (Peloubet quoted in Previts et al., 1990, p.137) but also in the shrouded existence of its more notorious members.\n",
      "Preston et al. 's findings concerning the emphasis on unwritten rules governing early professional behaviour (referred to here as \"etiquette\") and the reliance on the \"character\" of the entrant are supported by this study for an earlier time and place. However, unlike the early organisations of accountants in England, the US and Australia, the devising of ethical codes and disciplinary rules was not employed by the SAE at its formation in the mid-nineteenth century as part of an attempt \"to confer legitimacy upon the professional body\" (Preston et al., 1995, p.510). When a formal statement on disciplinary matters was later devised by the SAE it was a defensive mechanism necessitated by the publicised activities of a member whose criminal behaviour conflicted with the contemporary perception of the professional ideal. In this sense, Parker's assertion that the propagation of codes is primarily motivated by the \"protection of the accounting profession's self-interest\" (1994, p.507) is supported.\n",

      "The current study has confirmed the particular relevance within Parker's \"private interest model\" of the professional insulation and status preservation functions of organisational pronouncements. The revelations concerning the defalcations and immorality of Peddie required an institutional response in order to avert a threat to the hard won collective status gains amassed by Edinburgh CAs since 1853. It was also important that the SAE reveal that it had the capacity for instituting structures to enable the punishment of the dishonourable practitioner and thereby establish a potential deterrent.\n",
      "The case presented here also confirms Parker's contention that the exercise of discipline by the professional organisation is largely emblematic. In the wake of press comment relating to the activities of one chartered accountant, the SAE devised a regulation for the expulsion of members which stood as a symbol to the public that the association would not tolerate unbecoming and discreditable behaviour . The importance of \"offence visibility\" is also evidenced in the findings of this study. In this instance, the conspicuousness of the offence was not a determinant of the punishment meted out to the individual miscreant. Rather, it determined the formulation of the behavioural standard by which misconduct would be subsequently judged.\n",
      "The Callender and Peddie episodes also reveal that organisational responses were positively correlated to the volume of adverse publicity which resulted from the activities of dishonourable practitioners . Callender's misdemeanours elicited little press coverage and engendered a correspondingly limited reaction by the SAE. Peddie 's crimes, by contrast, though substantially unproven at the time, were sensationalised. Hence, the organisation not only expunged Peddie's name from the roll, but also acted expeditiously to institute regulations to uphold public confidence in the profession . The grounds for expulsion devised by the SAE in 1883 reveal the organisation's revulsion against any criminal behaviour or alleged act of wrongdoing which permeated the \"public\" domain and had the potential to discredit the vocation. As Parker has concluded, in matters of ethics and discipline the need to protect the private interest of the profession \"is ever present\" (1994, p.523).\n",

      "Notes\n",
      "1.\tThe derivation of the terms \"criminal upperworld\" and \"white-collar crime\" are explained in Robb (1992, pp.4 , 6 & 193).\n",
      "2.\tAdvertising and \"touting\" were major issues of etiquette during the late nineteenth century, especially in the English accountancy profession (see The Accountant; Howitt, 1984, pp.27-8). Canvassing was associated with trade and  the egoistic quest for \"profit\". It therefore conflicted with the ideal of the  fee-earning, financially disinterested and service orientated professional (Carr-Saunders & Wilson, 1933, pp.432-41; Duman, 1979, pp.124-7; Reader, 1966, p.159; Walker, 1988, pp.58-9).\n",
      "3.\tThe Rules and Bye-laws of the Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow also contained a provision which ensured that CAs who were engaged in \"the business of a Manufacturer, Merchant, or Law Agent\" would forfeit their membership of the Institute (Privy Council, 1890, p.120).\n",
      "4.\tAccording to Millerson, misconduct is most likely where a sole practitioner is involved in direct client relations, provides a fiduciary service and offers advice in complex matters (1964, p.157).\n",
      "5.\tIn November 1883 the actual total of forged bills discounted by Peddie at the head office of the Commercial Bank of Scotland was calculated as 10,678 (the  profits of the Bank during the financial year 1882-3 were 151,105) (Commercial Bank Minute Book, Vol.I 1, p.136). It was also revealed that the forged bills \"had been in the circle for several years\" (ibid.).\n",
      "6.\tIn their report on the accounts to 31 March 1882 the auditors stated that they had \"found the Books correctly kept, vouched and summed up\". The capital account was also examined \"and found correct\" (CH3/516/l, 9.5.1882).\n",
      "7.\tDeprecatory articles in The Financial Record, Economist, and Railway Review in 1881 were not the only adverse publicity which confronted the SAE in the period immediately preceding the Peddie affair. In May 1882 the case of Lees v. Todd was decided in the Court of Session. Here, a shareholder raised an action against the directors of the Caledonian Heritable Security Company for issuing false and fraudulent balance sheets. Although the defenders were successful, the case illuminated the perfunctory nature of the audit practices conducted by a CA. Both the manager and the auditor of the company were SAE members and one of the judges referred to their \"failure to perform their duty to the company\" (Session Cases, 1882, p.852) .\n",
